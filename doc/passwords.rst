14 days prior to their password expiry date, and on PMHC MDS login 7 days prior
to their password expiry - See see :ref:`soon-to-expire-password`.

If a password expires the user will not be able to access the PMHC MDS until they

the complexity requirements). Iif you receive a message that your current
password is incorrect, please reset your password through the link, :ref:`forgotten-password`.
