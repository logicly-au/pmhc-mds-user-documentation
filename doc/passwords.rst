      Enter your new password in the second and third box.

      Please note;
      * if you see the message 'Password unacceptably weak' after
      entering your new password, the password is not of sufficient complexity.

      find it easier to create a password that is 13 or more characters to avoid
      the complexity requirements)
      * if you receive a message that your current password is incorrect, please
      reset your password through the :ref:`forgotten-password`.
