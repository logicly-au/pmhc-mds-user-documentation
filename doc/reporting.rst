the 'Reporting' :ref:`roles`, when logged into the PMHC MDS on https://pmhc-mds.net.

If you don’t have access to the **Reports** tab and you believe you should, please
contact someone in your provider organisation or provider organisation's PHN
who has the 'User Management' role. If you are unsure who has the 'User Management'
role please email the PMHC Helpdesk at support@pmhc-mds.com

After navigating to the **Reports** tab, you will be able to view and export various

Types of System Reports
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The reports are grouped into five categories, each designed to serve different
purposes:

* :ref:`category-c`
* :ref:`category-d`
* :ref:`category-e`

.. _category-a:

Category A: Monitoring progress of MDS implementation

* :ref:`category-a7`
* :ref:`category-a8`

episodes where no contact has occurred for this period, but rather to identify
episodes that may warrant review.

Key specifications:

  end date of the report

.. _category-d:

Category D: Key Performance Indicators
--------------------------------------

A set of 13 key performance indicators was introduced in July 2016, designed to monitor the
progress of mental health reforms being led by Primary Health Networks (PHNs). The indicators
covered activities related to the delivery of services in six priority areas set by government, along
with two overarching program management indicators covering integrated service planning and
delivery, and implementation of stepped care models of care.

All 13 indicators were subsequently incorporated in schedules for mental health program funding,
requiring PHNs to report on performance annually. Data sources for the majority of indicators (11)
are derived in full or part from the Primary Mental Health Care Minimum Data Set (PMHC MDS).

The mental health KPIs were introduced prior to the implementation of the current PHN
Performance and Quality Framework (September 2018) and need to be positioned within that policy
framework. One additional indicator was added to the mental health KPIs as a result of the new
framework, bringing the total to 14.

9 of the 14 KPI reports will ultimately be available via the PMHC MDS. 7 are currently available:

* :ref:`category-acc-1`
* :ref:`category-acc-2`
* :ref:`category-acc-3`
* :ref:`category-app-1`
* :ref:`category-app-2`
* :ref:`category-app-3`
* Out-1 - Clinical outcomes - Low intensity psychological interventions
* Out-2 - Clinical outcome - Psychological therapies delivered by mental
  health professionals
* :ref:`category-out-3`

**Note:** Out-1 and Out-2 reports are still to be implemented.

The following reports are not available via the PMHC MDS as they require
information that is not derived from the PMHC MDS:

* Eff-1 - Average cost of PHN-commissioned low intensity psychological
  intervention services
* Eff-2 - Average cost of PHN-commissioned psychological therapies delivered by
  mental health professionals
* Eff-3 - Average cost of PHN-commissioned clinical care coordination for people
  with severe and complex mental illness
* Prog-1 - Proportion of PHN annual flexible funding allocated to low intensity
  services, psychological therapies and services for people with severe and
  complex mental illness

  support integrated regional planning and service delivery

.. _category-e:

Category E: Reports for data managers to monitor data supply
------------------------------------------------------------

These reports are designed to assist in monitoring the amount and type of data
that has been input into the MDS.

They are based on a subset of Category A reports but differ in two important ways:

* The reports are based on ‘raw data’, not filtered or trimmed by any data
  quality censoring. Comparable Category A reports restrict the reported data
  by specific edit criteria (e.g., Category A reports are only based on
  ‘active clients’, ‘active episodes’ and ‘active providers’)
