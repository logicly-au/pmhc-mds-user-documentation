Organisations
=============

You will be able to see the Organisations tab if you have been assigned
the 'Organisation Management', or the 'User Management' role, when logged into the PMHC MDS on https://pmhc-mds.net.

If you believe you should have access to an organisation and it doesn't appear
in your list please contact someone who has the 'User Management' role in that
provider organisation or the provider organisation's commissioning PHN.

If you are unsure who has the 'User Management' role please email the PMHC
helpdesk at support@pmhc-mds.com

After navigating to the organisation tab, you will be presented with a list of
top level organisations for which you have been assigned the 'Organisation Management'
or the 'User Management' role.
