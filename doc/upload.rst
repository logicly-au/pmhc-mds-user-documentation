  * **accept** - the file is currently going through the validation process
  * **complete** - the file has successfully passed the validation process
  * **error** - the file has returned errors through the validation process. Please review the error messages and correct the data to upload again

.. _upload-fixing-errors:

Correcting upload errors
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Any data errors will need to be corrected in your internal system and a new upload
file created. Or if you manually record data on the upload file, you can edit the
data records directly on the file.

The definition of each data item has associated notes that will provide guidance
on why an error is returned. By visiting the data specifications documentation
and clicking on the `Record formats <http://docs.pmhc-mds.com/en/v1/data-specification/data-model-and-specifications.html#record-formats>`_ field name this will take you to the
field definition which outlines the associated notes.

In the Frequently Asked Questions guide there are questions about some of the
common and unusual upload error messages. These answers contain information on
what you can do to fix the error. See - :ref:`Uploading Data FAQs <uploading-data-FAQs>`.

If you require assistance in understanding an error message, please email support@pmhc-mds.com.
