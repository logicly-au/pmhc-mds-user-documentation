Questions about Standard Reports
--------------------------------

Provider Organisations and Practitioners
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The documentation indicates standard reports will be designed to meet PHN and departmental requirements. Will a Provider organisation or Practitioner be able to receive reports for their respective service provision?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Department will be planning a range of standard reports and will consult with PHNs
about their requirements.  Standard Reports are expected to be developed for :ref:`Stage-Two`.

Ability through MDS system reports to separate by contract rather than by provider organisation. Many organisations have multiple contracts and are unable to do local level reporting solely via these.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Department is not considering reporting by contract at this stage but PHNs
have capacity to do this and are not confined to what is specified in the PMHC MDS.

Benchmarking reports
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Are the PHNs going to receive reports on collated data and benchmarked against other PHNs for QI purposes?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Department will be planning a range of standard reports and will consult with PHNs
about their requirements.  Standard Reports are expected to be developed for :ref:`Stage-Two`.

Effect Sizes (ES) are vulnerable to baseline severity and variance. Titov et al recently published a comparison of ESs vs. % changes in symptoms (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6062691/). To quote "Selecting statistics that overlook this proportional change (eg, Cohen d) is problematic". So why ES?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Effect size (also referred to as Cohenâ€™s d statistic) is a statistic used to assess
the magnitude of a treatment effect. It is calculated as the ratio of the difference
between the baseline (episode start) and follow-up (episode end) scores to the
standard deviation of the baseline score. Two of the mental health KPIs use the
effect size statistic to classify the outcomes of episodes into three categories:
Significant improvement, significant deterioration, no significant change.
The Department acknowledges that there are alternative approaches, including the
% changes in symptoms approach. It is also aware of the considerable published
literature and debate about the merits and pitfalls of various statistical
approaches to measuring change at the individual consumer level. The decision to
use effect size as the outcome metric was based on two main considerations. First,
effect size is the most commonly used metric used for reporting indicators of
consumer mental health outcome, both internationally and in Australia. And secondly,
the approach taken mirrors that developed for reporting summary indicators of
consumer outcomes by the state and territory mental health sector that have now
been in place for approximately a decade. Selection of the effect size statistic
as the preferred index of change was based on lengthy deliberation through the
AHMAC Mental Health Information Strategy Standing Committee and its expert subgroups.
Extensive experience in measuring and reporting consumer outcomes in mental health
care has subsequently developed, all built around the nationally agreed approach
to describing outcomes using the effect size statistic. The Commonwealth-funded
Australian Mental Health Outcomes and Classification Network (AMHOCN, www.amhocn.org)
serves as the national group that manages the data and provides industry support.
The Department is keen to align the approach taken in consumer outcome measurement
in primary health care with these national directions.

Why is the unit of count for the KPIs by episode of care instead of service contact? Why this change?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

As noted in the papers developed for the November 2018 national workshop on
PHN mental health data, the original 2016 KPI document was compiled prior to the
finalisation of the PMHC Minimum Data Set, and therefore required best guesses
to be made about several key issues that were not resolved at the time. Most
significantly, the concepts of episode and episode types had not been settled
when the original KPIs specifications were distributed. As such, several of the
KPIs were specified as to be calculated at service contact level as a compromise
rather than preferred solution.

Concepts of episodes of care are used widely throughout the health system as the
method to describe the activities of health services and to organise data collection,
reporting and analysis. Episodes represent aggregations of multiple service delivery
activities into a higher level and more useful construct to consider value for
money in healthcare. As an example, it is more meaningful to consider outcomes
at the consumer level for the entire course of treatment rather than for each
individual service contact. The same argument also applies to cost and related
concerns. This is not to imply that there is no value in focusing on the
individual treatment events that occur in episodes e.g., average cost of a
service contact versus cost per episode. The specification of the PHN KPIs at
episode level does not preclude these detailed indicators being developed and
used at the local and national level for specific purposes.

Why not include cost per outcome in the KPIs?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Mental Health Data Reference Group Terms of Reference includes provision of
advice on new approaches to performance measures and reporting. Further amendments
to the KPI set will be developed in consultation with the Reference Group.

Why do we need all those fields in the episode data? Not relevant to our commissioning decisions. Does the department need it for something?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Department is keen to work with PHNs to review the PMHC MDS to ensure that
it is only collecting essential data items that can be used. This review will
take place through the Reference Group. It should be noted that the intention of
this review is to ensure that the PMHC MDS continues to meet the requirements of
funding arrangements for the Department and for PHNs.

I thought the target for completion rates of outcome data was 70%?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This question was answered at the November 2018 national workshop - the target is 70% in 2018/19.
