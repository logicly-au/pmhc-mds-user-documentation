Questions about Standard Reports
--------------------------------

Provider Organisations and Practitioners
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The documentation indicates standard reports will be designed to meet PHN and departmental requirements. Will a Provider organisation or Practitioner be able to receive reports for their respective service provision?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Department will be planning a range of standard reports and will consult with PHNs
about their requirements.  Standard Reports are expected to be developed for :ref:`Stage-Two`.

Ability through MDS system reports to separate by contract rather than by provider organisation. Many organisations have multiple contracts and are unable to do local level reporting solely via these.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Department is not considering reporting by contract at this stage but PHNs
have capacity to do this and are not confined to what is specified in the PMHC MDS.

Benchmarking reports
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Are the PHNs going to receive reports on collated data and benchmarked against other PHNs for QI purposes?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Department will be planning a range of standard reports and will consult with PHNs
about their requirements.  Standard Reports are expected to be developed for :ref:`Stage-Two`.

Effect Sizes (ES) are vulnerable to baseline severity and variance. Titov et al recently published a comparison of ESs vs. % changes in symptoms (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6062691/). To quote "Selecting statistics that overlook this proportional change (eg, Cohen d) is problematic". So why ES?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Effect size (also referred to as Cohen’s d statistic) is a statistic used to assess
the magnitude of a treatment effect. It is calculated as the ratio of the difference
between the baseline (episode start) and follow-up (episode end) scores to the
standard deviation of the baseline score. Two of the mental health KPIs use the
effect size statistic to classify the outcomes of episodes into three categories:
Significant improvement, significant deterioration, no significant change.
The Department acknowledges that there are alternative approaches, including the
% changes in symptoms approach. It is also aware of the considerable published
literature and debate about the merits and pitfalls of various statistical
approaches to measuring change at the individual consumer level. The decision to
use effect size as the outcome metric was based on two main considerations. First,
effect size is the most commonly used metric used for reporting indicators of
consumer mental health outcome, both internationally and in Australia. And secondly,
the approach taken mirrors that developed for reporting summary indicators of
consumer outcomes by the state and territory mental health sector that have now
been in place for approximately a decade. Selection of the effect size statistic
as the preferred index of change was based on lengthy deliberation through the
AHMAC Mental Health Information Strategy Standing Committee and its expert subgroups.
Extensive experience in measuring and reporting consumer outcomes in mental health
care has subsequently developed, all built around the nationally agreed approach
to describing outcomes using the effect size statistic. The Commonwealth-funded
Australian Mental Health Outcomes and Classification Network (AMHOCN, www.amhocn.org)
serves as the national group that manages the data and provides industry support.
The Department is keen to align the approach taken in consumer outcome measurement
in primary health care with these national directions.


How to collect data for low intensity services?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The PMHC MDS includes a data item (Principal Focus of Treatment Plan) that requires
all episodes of care to be classified according to the main focus of the services
to be delivered to the client for the current episode of care. Principal focus of
treatment plan is a judgement made by the provider at the outset of service delivery.
It may be modified throughout the course of treatment if the initial assessment
proved incorrect. Episodes are classified into eight categories (or ‘episode types’):

* Psychological therapy
* Low intensity psychological intervention
* Clinical care coordination
* Complex care package
* Child and youth-specific mental health services
* Indigenous-specific mental health services
* Psychosocial support
* Other

Definitions of the categories, including for low intensity episodes, are available at
https://docs.pmhc-mds.com/data-specification/data-model-and-specifications.html#episode-principal-focus-of-treatment-plan

For the 2017-18 year, episodes classified as Low intensity made up approximately 10%
of all episodes of care reported by PHN commissioned providers.

It is acknowledged that the PMHC MDS arrangements work well for most instances of
individual client service delivery but are less feasible for some types of
low intensity services commissioned by PHNs. Additionally, some services that
the client is referred to may be out of scope for MDS reporting. The general
principle is that all services commissioned by PHNs that are targeted at
individual client service delivery are in scope for reporting to the PMHC MDS,
regardless of mode of service delivery. Where PHNs refer the consumer to self-help,
clinician unmoderated assistance (e.g., Mood Gym), this is not a PHN-commissioned
service as such and falls outside of the scope of collection. Similarly, referral
to a nationally funded clinician-moderated service such as Mindspot is not a
PHN-commissioned services and falls outside of scope, bypassing the need for
data collection.

However, there are acknowledged issues where a PHN enters a funding agreement
with a digital health provider to provide mental health services for their
regional population. These include, for example, funding a digital health provider
to deliver individually tailored, clinician-moderated services to specific
populations; or funding providers of user-pays digital app services to provide
such services free of charge to regional residents.

Such services clearly fall within scope of the PMHC MDS because they:

* are commissioned directly by the PHN; and
* are targeted at individual client service delivery.

However the department recognises that applying the full MDS requirements is not
practical in many instances as it can impose a significant barrier to clients
accessing those services. The Department aims to work with the re-established
PMHC MDS Reference Group to develop options for data collection and reporting on
a range of services that cannot be collected through the PMHC MDS.

Why is the unit of count for the KPIs by episode of care instead of service contact? Why this change?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

As noted in the papers developed for the November 2018 national workshop on
PHN mental health data, the original 2016 KPI document was compiled prior to the
finalisation of the PMHC Minimum Data Set, and therefore required best guesses
to be made about several key issues that were not resolved at the time. Most
significantly, the concepts of episode and episode types had not been settled
when the original KPIs specifications were distributed. As such, several of the
KPIs were specified as to be calculated at service contact level as a compromise
rather than preferred solution.

Concepts of episodes of care are used widely throughout the health system as the
method to describe the activities of health services and to organise data collection,
reporting and analysis. Episodes represent aggregations of multiple service delivery
activities into a higher level and more useful construct to consider value for
money in healthcare. As an example, it is more meaningful to consider outcomes
at the consumer level for the entire course of treatment rather than for each
individual service contact. The same argument also applies to cost and related
concerns. This is not to imply that there is no value in focusing on the
individual treatment events that occur in episodes e.g., average cost of a
service contact versus cost per episode. The specification of the PHN KPIs at
episode level does not preclude these detailed indicators being developed and
used at the local and national level for specific purposes.

Apart from the 'nice to know' analysis, why won't aggregate data which is sufficient for informing KPI level data suffice? Responding burden a major issue for smaller providers. Apart from general analysis, still not sure why Commonwealth needs such detailed data.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Unit record data is required to create aggregated data and allows the Commonwealth
flexibility to analyse PHN performance, including changes over time, without
requiring additional information.

Why not include cost per outcome in the KPIs?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Mental Health Data Reference Group Terms of Reference includes provision of
advice on new approaches to performance measures and reporting. Further amendments
to the KPI set will be developed in consultation with the Reference Group.

Is there any PMHC MDS requirement for 'Empowering Communities' Schedule?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There are currently only a small number of PHNs that have received the
Empowering Communities Schedule. There is no specific item in the PMHC MDS for
the Empowering Communities Schedule. Where a PHN receives funding under this
Schedule for Drought relief and uses the funding to provide individual services
to individuals, then these services are recordable under the PMHC MDS.

Why do we need all those fields in the episode data? Not relevant to our commissioning decisions. Does the department need it for something?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Department is keen to work with PHNs to review the PMHC MDS to ensure that
it is only collecting essential data items that can be used. This review will
take place through the Reference Group. It should be noted that the intention of
this review is to ensure that the PMHC MDS continues to meet the requirements of
funding arrangements for the Department and for PHNs.

Have key items from the PMHC MDS been defined for different service types in stepped care?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The PMHC MDS includes two complementary way of describing the types of care
delivered to individual clients:

 *  By episode type: all episodes of care are classified using the data item ‘Principal Focus of Treatment Plan’. The categories were developed to reflect the mental health reform priorities that are assigned to PHNs and documented in their funding schedules. There are eight categories of episode type:

    * Psychologicaltherapy
    * Lowintensitypsychologicalintervention
    * Clinical care coordination
    * Complexcarepackage
    * Child and youth-specific mental health services   * Indigenous-specific mental health services
    * Psychosocialsupport
    * Other

 *  By service contact: The main type of service delivered at each service contact is collected via the data item ‘Service Contact Type’. Nine types of service contact are defined.

    * Assessment
    * Structured psychological intervention
    * Otherpsychologicalintervention
    * Clinicalcarecoordination/liaison
    * Clinicalnursingservices
    * Child or youth specific assistance NEC
    * SuicidepreventionspecificassistanceNEC
    * CulturalspecificassistanceNEC
    * Psychosocialsupport

Used together, each of these data items allow the types of services delivered to
clients to be described. Please note that the PMHC MDS data requirements are
universal – that is, they apply to all episodes. Specific measures for different
types of episodes in the stepped care spectrum have not been defined.


How do we get the MDS data to be more consistent when most of the MDS data is captured by the referring agent (GP's)? The PHN does not have any leverage (Contracts or KPI's) to ask the referring agent to adhere to MDS requirements?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Department understands that PHNs are dependent upon referrers such as GPs to
ensure that all data is collected for the MDS, and to do this PHNs will need to
continue to build relationships with referrers. A considerable amount of
information in the MDS needs to be collected by the service provider to complement
the information provided by referrers.

I thought the target for completion rates of outcome data was 70%?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This question was answered at the November 2018 national workshop - the target is 70% in 2018/19.

Group services do not appear to fit well in the PMHC MDS?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Group services are all in scope to be reported. The PMHCS MDS includes an item
that allows group services to be identified – refer to Frequently Asked Questions,
Section 3.4.139. 'Service Contact – Participants', available at
https://docs.pmhc-mds.com/data-specification/data-model-and-specifications.html#service-contact-participants

Possibility of including multi-morbidity measures into the PMHC MDS for case mix adjustment etc?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Any new data items, including multi-morbidity measures, will be considered as part
of a broader review of the PMHC MDS.
