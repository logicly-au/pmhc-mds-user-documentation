.. _yes-phn-what-is-faq:

What is the YES-PHN survey?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The YES survey is designed to gather information from mental health consumers
about their experiences of care. By helping to identify specific areas where
quality improvements can be made, the YES can support collaboration between
mental health services and consumers to build better services.

accepted.

.. _yes-phn-upload-key-error-support-faq:

Why am I receiving an error with my Episode Key when I downloaded the data from the PMHC MDS?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Double check that the Episode Keys in the excel file you are uploading are identical
to the data in the PMHC MDS. This includes any leading zeros and prefixes.

When opening a file, Excel automatically removes leading zeros, and converts large numbers to
scientific notation, like 1.23E+15, in order to allow formulas and math
operations to work on them. To assist avoiding this issue, please view
Microsoft support documentation on "Keeping leading zeros and large numbers" -
https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/keeping-leading-zeros-and-large-numbers-1bf7b935-36e1-4985-842f-5dfa51f85fe7

If this change was intentional, see ::ref:`yes-phn-upload-edit-data-faq`.

.. _yes-phn-upload_error_log:

I am receiving an upload error that has a code that is not in my records. What should I do now?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We have implemented an upload error log that reports when an error is not
providing the relevant details. The error log code will be reported to the user
after the error message, for example [ABC123ZY]

The [AW97AZRX] error code refers to our internal error log. With this error code,
we will be able to quickly source you the relevant key details for this record.
And this error log is also reviewed by our developers to diagnose and fix the
specific error to ensure that the system reports the relevant details/keys for
