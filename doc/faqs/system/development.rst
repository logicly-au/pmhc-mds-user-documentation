Suggesting changes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In late 2018, the Department of Health reinstated the Primary Mental Health Care
Data Reference Group (PMHCDRG) to assist them with reviewing and prioritising
future PMHC MDS changes.

The PMHC Helpdesk often receives suggestions for changes to the current PMHC MDS
specifications and/or functionality, however, the Department would like all
suggestions to be formalised and to now go through PMHCDRG.

To assist you with the process of explaining your issue to the Department, please
find an example paper that Brisbane North produced that you can use as a best
practice sample - `Brisbane North PHN Example Paper </_static/SUB_BrisbaneNorthPHN_PMHC-MDS.pdf>`_.

Strategic Data are happy to provide comment on your paper before you formally
submit it. To request this, please contact the PMHC Helpdesk at support@pmhc-mds.com.

Final papers should be submitted directly to the Department of Health at
MentalHealthData@health.gov.au. However, we would appreciate it if you could
copy in the PMHC Helpdesk whenever possible.Â
