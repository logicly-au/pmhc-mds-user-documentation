.. _internet-browser:

What internet browser should I use?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can access the PMHC MDS using any up-to-date evergreen browser, like the following:

* Chrome (version 78+)
* Microsoft Edge (version 78+)
* Firefox (version 68+)
* Safari (version 13+)

Please note: Internet Explorer is no longer supported.

.. _getting-started-faq:

How do I get started using the MDS?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Each individual staff member should be set up with their own unique login access.
It is inadvisable to set up and use generic login accounts within the PMHC MDS,
and usernames / passwords should not be shared with other individuals. This
ensures that when a staff member leaves, their access can be easily disabled
without affecting other users or data security. A user’s account should not be
passed from one staff member to the next.

Refer to :ref:`how-do-i-obtain-access-to-the-mds` for information on
getting an account on the MDS.

The PMHC website is available at https://pmhc-mds.com/. Here you will find
documentation on using the MDS.

The MDS is accessed on the web at the following address: https://pmhc-mds.net/

.. _how-do-i-obtain-access-to-the-mds:

How do I obtain access to the PMHC MDS?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Access to the PMHC MDS is based on roles. Each role allows a user to perform
specific tasks, and a user can be assigned multiple roles. Each role is granted for a
user against an organisation. An organisation can either be a Primary Health
Network (PHN) or a Provider Organisation. If a user is granted a role for a
PHN they will also have this role for any Provider Organisations of that PHN.
A user can be invited to have a role at more than one organisations.

See :ref:`roles` for a summary of each of the roles that currently exist within the PMHC MDS.

User accounts can be created by a user at your PHN or provider organisation who
has the User Management role. If unsure who this is, please contact support@pmhc-mds.com
to find out who has this access.

Alternatively, if you cannot contact any users who have the User Management role
access can be gained by producing a :ref:`letter of authority <letter-of-authority-faq>`.

.. _letter-of-authority-faq:

What is required for the Letter of Authority?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A **letter of authority** is a written request made on your
Primary Health Network or Provider Organisation's letterhead which must be
signed by an authority at the Primary Health Network or Provider Organisation
who holds a position that is higher than the person for whom the account is
being created (i.e., the person's manager or the CEO).

This letter must contain the following details (for the person for whom
the MDS access is being requested/changed):

#. Name
#. Email address
#. Contact telephone number
#. Mobile phone number
#. The exact Primary Health Network or Provider Organisation's name in the MDS
   you are seeking to access
#. For new profiles, the roles required for the user. (See :ref:`roles` for a summary of each of the roles that currently exist within the PMHC MDS.)
#. For existing profile updates, list the item being changed (email or mobile), what is was and what it should be changed to

This letter must be faxed to (03) 9340 9090, or scanned and then emailed to support@pmhc-mds.com.

Refer to :ref:`why-letter-of-authority-faq`

.. _why-letter-of-authority-faq:

When is a Letter of Authority required?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The protocol for the PMHC MDS Helpdesk to set up a new account or change an
existing account requires a formal :ref:`letter of authority <letter-of-authority-faq>`.

When there are no existing users with the 'User Management' role at a PHN, the
protocol for setting up a new account to access this role, or granting this role
to an existing user, requires a written letter of authority by that PHN. Refer
to :ref:`how-do-i-obtain-access-to-the-mds`.

This protocol will also apply when a user is requesting an update to their profile
details when they are unable to log in. The :ref:`updating-your-details` process via the
MDS login screen is the preferred method for a user to update their own details.

The same protocol applies if a new MDS user requires MDS access using a past
users MDS access or email address. However, in this case it is advised that the
new MDS user has a new username and password issued to protect the privacy and
security of the organisation's data. Refer to :ref:`getting-started-faq`.

.. _what-can-a-user-see-faq:

What can a user see in the MDS?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

What you see after you login will depend upon the roles to which you have been assigned.

Refer to :ref:`roles` for more information.

.. _do-not-have-a-work-mobile-faq:

I do not have a work mobile. What do I do?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A user can use their personal mobile. Users' mobile phone numbers are not listed or viewable by other
users within the PMHC MDS.

The mobile is only used by the PMHC MDS profile management system to deliver the
verification code via SMS. This is used to activate their profile, reset their
password or if a password is forgotten or expires.

Refer to :ref:`password-recovery-faq`

.. _using-the-same-mobile-faq:

Can I invite different users by using the same mobile?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

It is not advised for multiple PMHC users to share using the same mobile number.

Refer to :ref:`I do not have a work mobile <do-not-have-a-work-mobile-faq>`, :ref:`letter of authority <letter-of-authority-faq>` and :ref:`password-recovery-faq`

.. _sharing-user-login-faq:

Can I pass on my username and password to my organisation's IT person or evaluator if they are entering data?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

No, each user should be issued with their own username and password.

Refer to :ref:`how-do-i-obtain-access-to-the-mds`

.. _adding-existing-user-faq:

Can I add an existing user to another PHN or Provider Organisation?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Yes, a user can have roles at more than one organisation.

By ensuring you enter the same email and mobile number when completing the invitation
steps in :ref:`adding-an-existing-user`, the system will automatically pick up if a user
already exists in the PMHC MDS and will grant them access to the additional organisation.

.. _outstanding-invite-exists-faq:

Why did I get this message when inviting a user - 'An error occurred: Inviting user failed: An outstanding PMHC MDS invite exists'?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

An invitation will be valid for 7 days. This user has previously been invited and has not yet completed the required
steps for :ref:`accepting-invitation`.

See :ref:`view-invite-details`.

.. _did-not-receive-email-invitation-faq:

What should I do if a user didn't receive the email invitation?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

First confirm that you have the users correct email address.  See :ref:`view-invite-details`.

* If the email is incorrect, you will be able to :ref:`delete-invite` and then send a new invitation.
* If the email is correct, ask the user to double check their junk mail folder and search for an email sent from noreply@logicly.com.au.

You can :ref:`reissue-invite`. When you reissue an invitation, both the email and SMS are sent again to the invitee.

If the email still doesn't arrive, please contact the Helpdesk on support@pmhc-mds.com

.. _did-not-receive-sms-invitation-faq:

What should I do if a user didn't receive the invitation SMS token?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Firstly confirm that you have their correct mobile phone number.  See :ref:`view-invite-details`.

* If the mobile is incorrect, you will be able to :ref:`delete-invite` and then send a new invitation.
* If the mobile is correct, ask the user to power off their mobile and turn it back on again as this does often
  help when an SMS hasn't arrived.

You can :ref:`reissue-invite`. When you reissue an invitation, both the email and SMS are sent again to the invitee.

If the SMS still doesn't arrive, please contact the Helpdesk on support@pmhc-mds.com

.. _deleted-email-sms-invitation-faq:

What should I do if a user deleted the email invitation or the SMS token?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can reissue an invitation which will send the invitee with a copy of their invitation email and SMS.

See :ref:`reissue-invite`.

.. _GP-provider-access-faq:

Can GPs or Mental Health Providers (MHPs) access the MDS to upload data themselves?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Yes, GPs and MHPs can access the MDS to upload their data directly into the
system. However, it is not possible to limit their data access to the
select data fields that they would normally manage. For example, MHPs would
normally only need to enter or edit their own client information and the episodes
and service contacts associated with these clients.

However, it is not possible to restrict their access only to their own clients'
data. They will be able to modify data for clients across their entire provider
organisation. Therefore, MHPs who access the MDS could potentially change data
for a client that is not their own.

Refer to :ref:`roles`.

.. _third-party-developer-access-faq:

I'm a third-party software developer developing software to assist with uploading data to the MDS. Can I have an account to test my data uploads?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Yes, we can supply you with an account that has access to a test Primary Health
Network. In order to set up the Primary Health Network account for the test environment, we need to
follow a similar procedure to setting up a Primary Health Network account for the production environment,
by producing a :ref:`letter of authority <letter-of-authority-faq>`.

On company letterhead, this letter must be signed by an authority at your company
who holds a position that is higher than the person for whom the account is being
created (i.e., the person's manager or the CEO).

This letter must contain the following details (for the person for whom
the MDS access is being requested):

#. The name of the person the account is for
#. The email address of the person
#. Contact telephone number
#. Mobile phone number
#. Request access to the 'Test [Your Company Name]' Organisation

This letter must be faxed to (03) 9340 9090, or scanned and emailed to support@pmhc-mds.com.

Base your letter on the details listed in :ref:`letter-of-authority-faq`

.. _testing-training-developer-access-faq:

Can I have an account to test adding data and for training new staff?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Yes, there is a Developers PMHC MDS website available for testing and training
purposes for PHNs, Provider Organisations and third-party developers.

To set up an account on https://developers.pmhc-mds.net/ please provide us with
a 'Letter of Authority' on your organisation's letterhead, similar to the one
outlined for third-party software developers.

See: :ref:`third-party-developer-access-faq`.

.. _forgotten-password-faq:

I forgot my password. What do I do?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

See :ref:`forgotten-password`.

.. _update-details-faq:

How can I update my user details?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If your email address or mobile number has changed, it is important that you update
your account. See :ref:`updating-your-details`.

If you can't access your profile, contact the PMHC Helpdesk so that your records
can be updated. When contacting the PMHC Helpdesk you will be asked to arrange
for a :ref:`letter of authority <letter-of-authority-faq>` stating the change(s)

Refer to :ref:`letter-of-authority-faq`

.. _password-recovery-faq:

How can I recover my password or username?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The system offers an automated password/username recovery feature. The system
will email the registered email address on your account and send an SMS to
the registered mobile phone on your account.

See :ref:`forgotten-password` for instructions on resetting your password.

It is important to keep your email address and mobile phone number current so that
you can make use of this facility. If you can no longer access the PMHC MDS
please email the PMHC MDS helpdesk at support@pmhc-mds.com to update your
email address/mobile phone.

Please note, when contacting the PMHC helpdesk you will be asked to arrange
for a :ref:`letter of authority <letter-of-authority-faq>` stating the change(s)
required. Refer to :ref:`letter-of-authority-faq`
