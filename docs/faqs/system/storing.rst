After entering data in the MDS how long should I store my hardcopy and/or electronic files?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There is no set time limit; however, it is recommended that you archive this data
and keep it secure for at least two years. As with all electronic data
(including MDS) there is a risk of corruption due to a system
bug or human error. The MDS stores the original upload files and the
imported data, however it is always
good to keep the original data as a backup to either check details against or
re-enter, if needed.
