.. _passwords:

Passwords Requirements
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

As required by the Australian Government's Protective Security Policy Framework
passwords must be changed every twelve months. If you do not change your password
it will expire and you will not be able to login to the system without resetting
your password.

Passwords must:

Use a strong random password or a passphrase. In either case this must be at
least 14 characters. Random passwords are best suited to users relying on a
password manager as they can be generated by the password manager and need not
be remembered. Use a passphrase if it must be remembered.

When using a passphrase ensure that they aren't easily guessable by:

* Using at least 4 random words. e.g. "magpie knuckle asteroid penance"
* Not using a list of categorised words. e.g. "apple kiwi melon pear"
* Not using a real sentence in a natural language. e.g. "The quick brown fox"
* Not using well known phrases such as those constructed from song lyrics, movies, literature or any other publicly available material. e.g. "super califragilistic expialidocious"

Please note: Users will be reminded via an email sent from noreply@logicly.com.au
14 days prior to their password expiry date, and on PMHC MDS login 7 days prior
to their password expiry - See :ref:`soon-to-expire-password`.

If a password expires the user will not be able to access the PMHC MDS until they
reset their password - See :ref:`forgotten-password`.
